Why important ? 
Helps in optimization-type problems (“find minimum/max possible value satisfying a condition”).
Trains you to convert problems into monotonic search space — an advanced skill.


Core Idea
- Instead of searching in array → you search in range of possible answers.
- You decide a predicate function can(mid) → returns true/false.
- Use binary search to minimize or maximize the answer satisfying condition.


+ After checking monotonicity property , find search space of it. 
+ Check how can reduce search space.
